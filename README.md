### TASK:2 Titanic Classification Predication ðŸ“ˆ

Predicting the Survival of Titanic Passengers:

I will go through the whole process of creating a machine learning model on the famous Titanic dataset, which is used by many people all over the world. It provides information on the fate of passengers on the Titanic, summarized according to economic status (class), sex, age and survival. We will do some basic data analysis, then some visulaization on the dataset, and in the end-use some of the popular models for prediction.

### TASK:3 Number Recoginition:

In this notebook, we are going to use the MNIST dataset for the implementation of a handwritten digit recognition app. To implement this we will use a special type of deep neural network called Convolutional Neural Networks.
